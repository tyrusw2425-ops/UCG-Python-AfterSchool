#Instructions and Hints for the Vowel Counter Program
# Program Purpose:
# This program asks the user to enter a word or sentence and then counts how many vowels
# appear in the text. It uses a user-defined function, a vowel list, a loop, and an if-statement
# to check each character and return the total number of vowels found.

#1. Create a function that will count vowels in a piece of text
#Hint: Use def to define your function and give it a name, like count_vowels.

#2. Inside the function, create a list of characters that are considered vowels
#Hint: Include both lowercase and uppercase vowels so the program counts all of them (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U).

#3. Make a counter that starts at 0
#Hint: This counter will increase each time the program finds a vowel.

#4. Loop through the text one character at a time
#Hint: Use a for loop to check each letter in the user’s input.

#5. Check whether the current character is a vowel
#Hint: Use an if statement and the keyword in to see if the character is inside the vowel list.

#6. If the character is a vowel, increase the counter
#Hint: Add 1 to your counter each time a vowel is found.

#7. After the loop ends, return the final number of vowels counted
#Hint: The return statement sends the final count back to the main program.

#8. Ask the user to type in a word or sentence
#Hint: Use input() to collect text from the user.

#9. Call your function and pass the user’s text into it
#Hint: Place the user’s input inside the parentheses when calling the function.

#10. Print the result inside a clear sentence
#Hint: Use an f-string to neatly show the number of vowels to the user.
